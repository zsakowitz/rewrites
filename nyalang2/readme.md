## mvp ideas

what are the bare essentials we need?

- define types and functions in JS
- make coercion sensible AND extensible (complex matrices should Just Work)
- list broadcasting and spreading (`min` and `+` come to mind)
- const and runtime values
- output to multiple languages

okay! let's go make those. wait no actually let's think about environments

## environments

let's think about where we want to use this language:

| environment   | dep decl     | dep uses     | requirements                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| dcg clone     | f(x) = expr  | auto-updated | only pure fns + know callable fn names (for deitalicization) |
| notebook      | maybe a := b |              | output to multiple locations                                 |
| manim clone   |              |              | scenes, procedures, animations, and mutation                 |
| from js       |              |              | call fns, create values, .d.ts generation                    |
| cgsuite clone |              |              | recursive functions                                          |
| game dev??    |              |              | import models                                                |

it looks like dep tracking should probably be localized in dcg then, although
reactive scripts for animation and notebooks would be really helpful

plus: how do we do sliders? we should ponder this early on. best approach is the
"pipeline" one, where every builtin functions knows how it interacts with
sliders, and things like `translate` and `+` which are impld in the scripting
language just take advantage of it by piping down variables. this could work
really well with a custom emit to a symbolic ish lang (`num` is actually either
a numeric constant, or `a+b*<declared variable>`). i like this approach, so
let's make sure std is easily extensible

btw: the current calculator impl generates text, and we decide whether to
generate js or glsl afterwards, which is nice for flexibility. should we change
that, seeing how dcg has quite unique syntax which doesn't really fit into an
actual scripting language? or should we make the language flexible enough to
accomodate all of dcg's weirdness?

for js interp, we could try to use decorators. idk how, but they sound cool.
actually that means they're probably the wrong choice (using a language feature
for the sake of it), scrap it. plus it's not mvp worthy at all, and we can't do
standalone functions

## language goals

what are the core parts of nyalang that NEED to exist?

- function overloading
- operators are just functions
- type coercion
- easily maps from dcg latex
- can provide display output

so what is an actual nyalang mvp?

- **NO ACTUAL LANGUAGE**
- define types and functions in JS
- make coercion sensible AND extendable (complex matrices should Just Work)
- that's basically it??
- no, we also have list broadcasting

how do we do lists?

- make a distinction between lists, vectors, and matrices
- a list is desmos-style

how do we do functions?

- low-level, function calls should be `lib.call(id("+"), [arg1, arg2])`
  - as an api, `lib.call("+", arg1, arg2)` is also sensible
- we need to deal with broadcasting: maybe ndarrays are the way to go
  - nyalang 2 should definitely have ndarrays
- rest parameters: do we want them?
  - not really; functions which take a single list already cover that path
- do we want named parameters? if yes, then probably the python route
  - most languages get by without them, so let's say no
  - what does rust do? rust usually has long function names instead
  - so maybe they can exist in the api, but be ignored elsewhere
  - or they can be syntax sugar for something
  - or we remake the language again when we want them
  - this last one sounds good

## scribblings

failures of the first language:

- didn't consider all types early enough, so coercions were an afterthought and
  generics didn't exist at all
- no guarantee on code execution order and short-circuiting
- almost no fns could be made constant
- standard library definitions were a mess
- ways to interact with external JS were an afterthought
- zero ways for draggables to work
- every emit target was hardcoded, but we need 3-5 targets (glsl, js w/ inexact
  fractions, js w/ exact fractions, possibly webgpu and dcg in the future)
- optimization was entirely manual (@+, @mix, etc.)
- zero support for recursion
- like four ways to name functions
- strings barely work
- no way to preserve error locations from latex
- only one error at a time
- every function is exposed to calculator
- global `use`

good things of the first language:

- operator overloading
- broadcast operators
- prettier
- latex tags (maybe?)

how do we do better?

- write std in the language itself
- ban recursive functions from shaders, but allow them to be written
- only `pub fn` are shown in calculator
- ensure code is executed in a defined order
- better prettier algos
- collect errors in some structure, and throw them once at the end

how are we going to store types?

- some fundamental types need to exist: bool, num, void, str
- add tuple types as a core construct
- instead of void, we'll have the empty tuple `()`

how are we going to play games? how do we do type-associated consts and types?

```rs
trait Game {
  type Move;

  fn make_move(&mut self, mv: Move);
  fn undo_move(&mut self, mv: Move);
}
```

do we want a trait system? maybe:

```nya
trait Point2D {
  fn x(x: Self) -> num;
  fn y(x: Self) -> num;
}

// impl is minimal since fn declarations would exist elsewhere
impl Point2D: (num, num);
impl Point2D: Complex;
```

## on numbers and games

if we have traits, games come somewhat naturally:

```nya
trait Game {
  type Move;

  fn gen_moves(game: Self) -> [Self::Move];
  fn make_move(ref game: Self, mv: Self::Move);
  fn undo_move(ref game: Self, mv: Self::Move);
}

struct LemonGame {
  x: num,
  y: num,
}

type Move for LemonGame = (num, num);

fn gen_moves(game: LemonGame) -> [(num, num)] {
  let mut ret = [] :: [(num, num)];

  for i in 1..=game.x {
    ret.push((i, 0));
  }

  for i in 1..=game.y {
    ret.push((0, i));
  }

  for i in 1..=min(game.x, game.y) {
    ret.push((i, i));
  }

  ret
}

fn make_move(ref game: LemonGame, move: Move) {
  game.x -= move.x;
  game.y -= move.y;
}

fn undo_move(ref game: LemonGame, move: Move) {
  game.x += move.x;
  game.y += move.y;
}
```

if we do that, how do arrays of games work? bc `[lemon, nim]` would be an array
of distinct types.

or we could have games as an enum of sorts, but that seems painful to extend.

conclusion: games are hard, but if we can do them, we win at programming. but i
don't think we will do them as a builtin

## on matrices

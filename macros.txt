Throughout this file, macros show their arguments and cells they use.

Cell modification types:
  "pops N values"      a macro modifies the current cell and (n-1) previous cells.
  "uses this cell"     a macro modifies the current cell.
  "uses next N cells"  a macro modifies the next (n) cells, not including the current one.

Instruction types:
  "go to cell X"       a line of code moves the pointer to cell X
  "de/increment X"     a line of code decrements or increments cell X
  "move cell X to Y"   a line of code moves the value of cell X to cell Y
  "copy cell X to Y"   a line of code copies the value of cell X to cell Y

@multiply      pops 2 values, uses next 2 cells
  // In this script, cell A is the multiplicand. Cell B is the multiplier,
  // cell C is the temporary output, and cell D is used during the copy process.
